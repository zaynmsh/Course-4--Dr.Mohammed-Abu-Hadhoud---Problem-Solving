Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter their age.
The program should make sure that the entered age is within a specific range (for example, between 10 and 20).
If the age is outside this range, the program should display an error message and ask the user to enter the age again until a valid value is entered.
After a valid age is entered, the program should print the age on the screen.
