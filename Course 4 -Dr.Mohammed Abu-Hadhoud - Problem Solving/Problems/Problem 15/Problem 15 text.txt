Problem Description:
Write a C++ program that reads the total sales amount from the user and calculates
the sales commission based on the following conditions:

| Total Sales (USD)           | Commission Rate |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| ≥ 1,000,000                 | 1%              |
| ≥ 500,000 and to 1,000,000   | 2%              |
| ≥ 100,000 and to 500,000     | 3%              |
| ≥ 50,000 and to 100,000      | 5%              |
| < 50,000                    | 0%              |

The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter the total sales.
2. Determine the commission percentage based on the sales amount.
3. Calculate and print both the commission percentage and the total commission value.
Each step should be implemented in a separate function.
