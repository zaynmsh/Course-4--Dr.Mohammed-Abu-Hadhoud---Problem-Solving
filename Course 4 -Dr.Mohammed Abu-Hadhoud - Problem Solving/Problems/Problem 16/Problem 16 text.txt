Write a C++ program that reads the content of a piggy bank, including the total number of:
- Pennies
- Nickels
- Dimes
- Quarters
- Dollar bills

The program should then:
1. Calculate the total value in pennies.
2. Convert the total value to dollars.
3. Display both the total in pennies and in dollars.

The program should use a structure (struct) to store the piggy bank content.
