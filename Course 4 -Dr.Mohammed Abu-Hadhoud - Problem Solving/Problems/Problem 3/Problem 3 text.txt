 Write a C++ program that defines a structure named
  `stPersonInfo` to store information about a person,
  including:
      - Name (string)
      - Age (int)
      - HasDriverLicense (bool)

  The program should:
  1. Read the person's name, age, and whether they have
     a driverâ€™s license (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
  2. Check if the person is accepted or rejected based
     on the following rule:
         - Accepted if Age > 18 AND HasDriverLicense = true
         - Otherwise, Rejected.
  3. Print "Accepted" or "Rejected" accordingly.
