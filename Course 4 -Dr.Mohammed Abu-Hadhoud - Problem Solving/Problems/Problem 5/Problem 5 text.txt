Problem Statement:

  Write a C++ program that:
  1. Reads a number from the user.
  2. Calculates half of that number.
  3. Determines whether the half value represents
     a "Pass" or "Fail" according to the following rule:
        - Pass if half of the number > 60
        - Otherwise, Fail
  4. Prints the result as "Pass" or "Fail"
     and displays the half value formatted
     to 3 decimal places.
