 Write a C++ program that:
  1. Reads three integer numbers from the user.
  2. Calculates the sum of the three numbers.
  3. Calculates the average of the three numbers.
  4. Checks whether the average value represents "Pass"
     or "Fail" based on the following rule:
         - Pass if the average > 40
         - Otherwise, Fail
  5. Prints "Pass" or "Fail" accordingly.
