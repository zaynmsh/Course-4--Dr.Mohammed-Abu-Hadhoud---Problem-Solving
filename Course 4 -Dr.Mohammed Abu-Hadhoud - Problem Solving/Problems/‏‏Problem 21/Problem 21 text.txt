Write a C++ program that calculates the final total bill after adding service fees and taxes.

The program should ask the user to enter the original bill amount,
then apply:

10% service fee, and

16% tax on top of the total (after service).

Finally, the program should display the original bill and the total bill after adding service and tax.
